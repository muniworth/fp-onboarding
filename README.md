# Approach
Most developers learn to solve problems by declaring temporary variables and for loops, an antipattern Venkat Subranium calls [Primitive Obession](https://youtu.be/znZlF4uQBN0?t=1047). It doesn't allow for progress when you get stuck on a difficult problem, and results in unreadable, buggy code.

Instead, solve problems using a rigorous step-by-step approach:
1. Construct a domain model (only relevant if there's a domain to model, which isn't the case for Leetcode questions).
2. Specify type signature.
3. Write the type transformation pipeline (ex. reduce, scan, etc.)
4. Solve the problem one step at a time by implementing transformations.
5. Specialize the transformations using standard library functions. ex. Sum is a specialization of plus-reduce. Length is a specialization of count-reduce.

Using a rigorous approach increases the likelihood of writing maintainable code. Some problems don't require type transformations (ex. Leetcode's spiral matrix traversal), which makes them more difficult.

# Example
Given a table of numbers, create a total column.
```
Step 1
empty, since there are no domain types to model.

Step 2
number[][] -> number[]

Step 3
input
|> reduce rank2

Step 4
input
|> Array.map (fun cs -> Array.reduce (+) cs)

Step 5
input
|> Array.map Array.sum
```

### Functors and Monads
Definition 1 (loosely taken from Richard Feldman in the podcast Software Unscripted):
A monad is a `.then()`-able, i.e. a chainable data structure that takes callbacks

Definition 2 (from Mark Seemann):
A monad is a functor that can be flattened.
`Bind === FlatMap === Map >> Flat`
A functor is a container that you can map over (i.e. inject transform logic into).

# Leetcode Problems
For all problems, you can copy in any standard library function, ex. Scan or Iota. Focus on readability, not performance.

[Longest Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)
Hint: you should use a library function not provided by JavaScript.

[Duplicate Zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/duplicate-zeros/)
The problem says to mutate the input, so solve using a pure function and copy the results over:
```ts
const xs2 = duplicateZeros(xs)
for (let i=0; i < xs.length; i++) {
   xs[i] = xs2[i]
}
```

[Trapping Rainwater](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)
Hint: you need at least 2 passes over the array (forward and back). Remember that Scan returns a longer array than the input.

# Custom Problems
### 1
We have several teams of people, each defined as a list of team member names. Write code that returns the size of the largest team.
```
example 1
input: [["alice"], ["bob", "charlie"]]
output: 2

example 2:
input [["alice", "bob", "charlie"]]
output: 3
```

### 2
We make 1 dollar per month, increasing to 2 dollars per month starting in March. Given a fiscal year start month (numeric, 1-indexed) as input, return an array of our income for each month.
```
example 1
input 1// January
output [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

example 2
input: 3// March
output: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

example 3
input: 4// April
output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]
```

### 3
A list contains 2 types of particles: positive '+' or negative '-'. We select one index 'p' as the anchor point. Write code to gather all negative charges around the anchor point, while pushing the positive charges away. Charges may not cross over the anchor point. Your solution should be linear in time complexity.
```
example input list:
[-, +, -, -, +, -, +]
output for each index:
[-, -, -, -, +, +, +], p=0, p=1
[+, -, -, -, -, +, +], p=2
[+, -, -, -, -, +, +], p=3, p=4
[+, +, -, -, -, -, +], p=5, p=6
[+, +, +, -, -, -, -], p=7
```
