# Algorithm Intuition
Most developers solve problems by declaring temporary variables, an anti-pattern Venkat Subramaniam calls [Primitive Obession](https://youtu.be/znZlF4uQBN0?t=1047), then writing logic step-by-step inside loops. It's easier to break a problem into composable sub-problems if you follow a rigorous step-by-step approach:
1. Specify type signature.
2. Write a pipeline that implements the type signature (expand, transform, reduce).
3. Solve the problem one step at a time by writing callbacks within the pipeline.
4. Specialize the algorithms using standard library functions. ex. Sum is a specialization of plus-reduce. Length is a specialization of count-reduce.

## Example
Given a UI table, create a total column.
```
Step 1
number[][] -> number[]

Step 2
input |> reduce rank2

Step 3
input |> Array.map (Array.reduce (+))

Step 4
input |> Array.map Array.sum
```

### Transform Exercises
#### [1089. Duplicate Zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/duplicate-zeros/)
The problem says to mutate the input, so if solving on Leetcode, use a pure function and copy the results over:
```ts
const xs2 = duplicateZeros(xs)
for (let i=0; i < xs.length; i++) {
   xs[i] = xs2[i]
}
```

#### Charged Particle Movement
A list contains 2 types of particles: positive '+' or negative '-'. We select one index 'p' as the anchor point. Write code to gather all negative charges around the anchor point, while pushing the positive charges away. Charges may not cross over the anchor point. Your solution should be linear in time complexity.
```
example input list:
[-, +, -, -, +, -, +]
output for each index:
[-, -, -, -, +, +, +], p=0
[-, -, -, -, +, +, +], p=1
[+, -, -, -, -, +, +], p=2
[+, -, -, -, -, +, +], p=3
[+, -, -, -, -, +, +], p=4
[+, +, -, -, -, -, +], p=5
[+, +, -, -, -, -, +], p=6
[+, +, +, -, -, -, -], p=7
```

#### Robot Cleaner
A room exists on a cartesian plane, with dirty areas represented as points on the plane. Pathfind a robot cleaner through a room, starting from point `[1, 1]`. Move to points in the order given.
1. Output 'W' or 'E' for horizontal movement
2. Output 'N' or 'S' for vertical movement
3. Output 'C' when the robot cleans.
4. Output a space between each character.
```
sample input text:
`[2, 4]
[1, 3]
[4, 1]
[3, 2]
`
output:
`E N N N C W S C E E E S S C W N C`
```

### Reduction
Ken Iverson coined `Reduce` in his 1962 book "A Programming Language", which introduced Iversonian Notation and inspired [APL](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Simple_examples). APL is the subject of his Turing award paper "[Notation as a Tool of Thought](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~jzhu/csc326/readings/iverson.pdf)". In the context of arrays, `Reduce` reduces one axis of an N-dimensional array, yielding an (N-1) dimensional array (or scalar). For now we'll only consider arrays, but in general, `Reduce` reduces a foldable data structure to a summary value one element at a time. We classify reductions by the binary function used, called a *reducer* or *folder*.

|        | Direction     | Operator  | Initial Value | Type Signature                  |
| ------ | ------------- | --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Reduce | Associative   | Monoid    | No            | (A → A → A) → A[] → A           |
| Seduce | Associative   | Semigroup | No            | (A → A → A) → non-empty A[] → A |
| FoldL  | Left-to-Right | Binary    | Yes           | (B → A → B) → B → A[] → B       |
| FoldR  | Right-to-Left | Binary    | Yes           | (A → B → B) → B → A[] → B       |

A **semigroup** is pairing of a data type with an associative binary operator on that type.

```haskell
-- Def'n of associativity for an operator/function 'op'.
-- This must hold true for a type and operator to form a semigroup.
op (op x y) z = op x (op y z)-- prefix notation
(x `op` y) `op` z = x `op` (y `op` z)-- infix notation

typeclass Semigroup a where
    op :: a -> a -> a

-- Integers form a semigroup under the operation of maximum
instance Semigroup Int where
    op = max
```

A **monoid** is a semigroup with an identity value.

```haskell
id `op` x = x-- Left Identity
x `op` id = x-- Right Identity

-- Integers form a monoid under the operation of multiply with an identity of 0
typeclass Monoid a extends Semigroup a where
    unit :: a
    op :: a -> a -> a

instance Monoid Int extends Semigroup Int where
    unit = 0
    op = multiply

-- Strings form a monoid under the operation of union with an identity of ""
instance Monoid String extends Semigroup String where
    unit = ""
    op = union
```

Language implementations of reduce/fold vary significantly, and many use a single function for every variation. For example, JavaScript and FSharp both throw if you don't provide an initial value for an empty list, unlike APL which infers the identity from the binary operator. More variations are possible: C++ has `fold_right_first` and `fold_left_first` which don't require an initial value, and `accumulate` with directionality defined by an iterator.

   <summary>Array Rank</summary>

When working with multi-dimensional arrays, it's useful to know the leading axis convention. We count arrays from the outside in, and apply functions across a specific rank. In [array languages]((https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/leading.html)) that follow this convention, omitting the rank modifier defaults to rank 1.
|               | Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 | Rank 2 Sum | Rank 2 Length |
| ------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Row 1         | 1     | 2     | 3     | 6          | 3             |
| Row 2         | 1     | 2     | 3     | 6          | 3             |
| Rank 1 Sum    | 2     | 4     | 6     |            |               |
| Rank 1 Length | 2     | 2     | 2     |            |               |

For functions that operate on arrays (ex. length), each increase in rank adds one additional Map before calling the function:
```
// rank 1
input |> Array.length
// rank 2
input |> Array.map Array.length
```

When acting on cells, you can index across them (for brevity this code assumes a rectangular, non-empty array).
```
// rank 1
input.[0] |> Array.mapi (fun i _ -> input |> Array.map (Array.item i) |> Array.sum)
// rank 2
input |> Array.map Array.sum
```

`SumRank1` is equivalent to `Transpose >> SumRank2`.

### Expansion Exercises
#### Change on Fiscal Month
We make 1 dollar per month, increasing to 2 dollars per month starting in March. Given a fiscal year start month (numeric, 1-indexed) as input, return an array of our income for each month.
```
// example 1
input 1// January
output [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

// example 2
input: 3// March
output: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

// example 3
input: 4// April
output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]
```

## Specialization
Projection is a common specialization, denoted by `<name>By`. For example:
```
// Less Specialized
users |> Array.Find (fun x -> x.Name = "Bob")

// More Specialized
users |> Array.FindBy _.Name (= "Bob")
```

Always use the most specialized form of an algorithm possible. There are exceptions to this rule, ex. `+/` in APL is already quite terse, so defining `Sum` wouldn't make sense. Function specializations usually form a tree, ex. this figure for [Mismatch](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/mismatch)
